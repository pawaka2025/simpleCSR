How are sparse matrices made?

Consider this adjacency matrix:

0 2 0 0 3
2 0 4 5 0 
0 4 0 6 0
0 5 6 0 7
3 0 0 7 0

We have a number of methods to represent a sparse matrix. For now we can go with CSR.

The CSR method.

1 - Derive a data array, consisting of non-zero values.
[2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 6, 5, 6, 7, 3, 7]

2 - Derive a column index array, consisting of columns these non-zero values are located at:
[1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3]

3 - Derive a row pointers array, consisting of cumulative numbers of rows occupied by non-zero values
We need to add an extra element on the front consisting of the value 0.
[0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12]

Why? To facilitate performing operations (like matrix-vector multiplication).
Keeping the arrays as single dimensional allows easier contiguous reads in memory. 

We generally need a column and row in a CSR struct. Even though adjacency matrices are square, some graphs are not
(ie bipartite graphs).
